# CPPFinal

This is my final project for my C++ class at Oklahoma City Community College. The project name is UFO Joe, it is a game developement engine
created mostly from scratch using C++ and OpenGl with a few supporting libraries. There are minimal features and plenty of bugs to squash
but the main challenge for this project was to see how ambitious, in depth, and technical a project I could make with just two weeks time.
