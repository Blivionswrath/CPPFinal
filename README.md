# CPPFinal
Final project for C++ Online OCCC 2022
This is my final project for my C++ class at OCCC. The project name is UFO Joe and it is a game developement engine
created mostly from scratch using C++ and OpenGl with a few supporting libraries. There are minimal features and plenty of bugs to squash
but the main challenge for this project was to see how ambitious, in depth, and technical a project I could make with just two weeks time.
UFO Joe's developement may proceed in the future or the engine repurposed, but as of right now I have no plan to continue contributing to this
project.
